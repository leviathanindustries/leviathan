# The new plan

## Teaching as a hobby

## Casual teaching

<img class="img img-thumbnail" src="{{api}}/img?w=600&url=https://dev.bebejam.com/static/beach.jpg" style="width:100%;">

The site should be for yoga teachers who want to easily offer small one-to-one
classes wherever they are, at a discount rate. This is not for "pro" teachers,
who are doing it full time and run big classes, more for people who just want
to easily offer a few classes every now and then, or maybe up to running a
short block of classes in a local hall for a fixed period of time.

<S>

<M>

There can be a lot of hassle involved in organising larger classes and organising
spaces, and covering the costs of deposits, and cleaning up etc, and if it goes
well everyone expects it to become regular, which becomes restrictive. This does
not suit well for people who are busy with another profession, or who are traveling,
or otherwise not wanting to commit to building up a long term class presence /
permanent studio, etc.

It should also be useful for people who are not highly trained in teaching yoga -
e.g. someone who has done some teacher training and just wants to find people
happy to try it with a less experienced teacher, which is why it can reasonably
be expected to be discounted in price. The teachers can still clearly set any
price that they want to set though.

<X>

So a new yoga teacher in an area, wanting to meet some people to try their teaching
with, may start by offering free/cheap classes to friends/acquaintances, and these
classes just occur in whatever space is available - a lounge, a shared office, etc.
They are low cost, fun, everyone benefits - the teacher gets practice teaching, the
students get to try something new, and probably still get good teaching anyway (as
beginners, they don't need high level training, as long as it is a good understanding
of the basics and how to do them safely).

If this goes well for the trainer, friends/acquaintances will start asking the
trainer to do more classes, and even offering small amounts of money to cover any
costs, such as getting a slightly bigger training venue like a local hall. However,
the aspect of money can make it  hard for people, whether friends or not, because
people can feel uncomfortable discussing money or "expecting" money from "friends".

Then, with a little success, the teacher feels confident to "advertise" to a wider
community. This is ideally done via communities that already exist, such as local
facebook groups. This is easier than expecting people to join some new community
for some thing they may not even know they want, and for which they do not
understand the benefit.

So the teacher puts a message up, offering a class to anyone interested, for low
price, at a convenient time and place that will be arranged by discussion with
those who show interest. Experience indicates that the demand for this is actually
too high, and the teacher ends up with a lot of people wanting to attend. This is
great! But, causes problems for the teacher, vis. the above points about organising,
hiring space, paying deposits, cleaning, commitment to longer term, etc.

BUT the customers who enjoyed the class do still exist, and the demand has been
created by the new teacher, and people start asking if there will be another class
"next week", or on different days, or at different times, etc. So now there is a
market demand, and a lack of resource to fill it.

Also, by becoming visible in the local community, new opportunities that may
suit the occasional teacher come to light - e.g. local gyms get in touch to
ask if the teacher may be available as a backup, and just get in touch at
random when the new teacher may be in the area and available, to ask if they
can cover classes at short notice, etc (which also for those eventually wishing
to become full time teachers may be an interesting way of getting fixed work).

Ideally at this point the trainer wants to be able to easily offer and organise
smaller simple classes with small groups that can still be done with little
organisational effort, in free/easy locations, and get small but reasonable
payment, say by contacting some of the interested people and offering them
private classes in their house for them alone or with one or two friends. At
this point the teacher has overcome the suspicion or disinterest of potential
customers, and the customers may even be messaging the teacher asking for this
themselves, e.g. because they attended or heard about that one-off (or set of a
few) classes that other locals enjoyed, but the time was not ideal for them, so
they would like something similar in a more convenient way.

Alternatively, the "mobile" / "occasional" trainer may now want to go off and do
whatever else takes up their life, e.g. their main profession, or travel to their
next location... but they don't want to lose all of the good will / reputation,
and experience they have gained by successfully running these few small local classes.
They need their "reputation" to become portable - not reliant on a given location
or group of people, or temporal regularlity, but able to transcend those restrictions
to be put to good use at later times. e.g. a teacher may travel somewhere new, and
needs to be able to easily get over that disinterest/suspicion hurdle again, by
being able to say "here is what I have done before, I already offered x and y classes
and people positively reviewed them and wanted me to do more".

For a new trainer, advertising in a community facebook page for example requires a lot
of time. Posting, repeat posting, responding to comments, asking for feedback, etc,
can quickly become a full time job, which was not the aim of the teacher. So, this cannot
easily be avoided the first time round for any new teacher, but there is a
lot of value in making this more portable, and perhaps in supporting a new teacher in
aggregating and tracking their interactions, that help to show they are "trustworthy"
by being part of various communities, even if only temporarily.

Organising venues for more than around three people is hard, and starts to incur hourly
costs as well as financial requirements such as deposits. For example, running a one
hour class will likely involve two hours, with prep and cleaning included; along with this,
there can be about a day of admin to do in terms of finding interested people, organising
them to pick a time and roughly convenient area, then finding a venue, booking it, etc.

Also, it is harder to teach bigger classes of people who can have different skill levels,
injuries, limitations, etc. Teaching a small group is easier for a new teacher - but,
contrary to this, customers are more likely to pay for one-to-one personal training with
expert teachers, not with new teachers. So new teachers need this way to be able to find
people willing to be their "test subjects", and who in return get a price much better
than a "proper" personal trainer.

<X fixed bg="{{api}}/img?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcottagelabs.com%2Fstatic%2Fpeople%2Fmark.jpg&w=1000&h=800&sepia=true&saturate=5&mix=FFFFFF,70">

The extra earnings of teaching a big class is not necessarily attractive enough, for teachers
who don't want to commit to this kind of work full time. They don't want to do all the admin,
etc. But they would still like to be able to share their skills.

## So: WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE WITH SOME TEACHING SKILLS TO TEACH CASUALLY

<E>

What can be the benefits for teachers?

* A teacher should be able to easily offer small cheap classes to share their knowledge
* A teacher should be able to more easily find spaces to hire (maybe)
* A teacher should be able to easily set (and change) prices for a class, and get commitment from people to pay
* A teacher should be able to maintain a reputation across time and space
* A teacher should be able to easily replicate their small successes in different places, or at later times


So we expect teachers should use what is available to find people locally and get some initial customers.
This is something like facebook groups, local message boards (online and at e.g. supermarkets) etc.
But we should help them be able to pull this together more easily when it comes to organising classes
and collecting some money, and having a record of the classes they have done in the past.

<X>

And what about for the customers?

Customers have to be a secondary target for the time being - once there is more use of the site,
then it will have more value to customers because they could actually use it to find local available
teachers, and to check their reputation.

But to begin with, customers are a resource that trainers will have to search for, and bring in.
Then, customers need to be "mined" for reviews. How can we incentivise customers to give reviews?

Teachers could offer further discount on price if customer leaves review - but this undermines the
argument that the teacher is already offering a super discounted rate; if it can be reduced further,
this claim is called into question.

Teachers could offer "report cards" - so, helping the customer overcome the problem of the occasional
teachers, the customers get an online report of how they did at each class, so then their writing a
review is complimentary to their receiving a history of their progress.

BUT is this something a customer would value? And is it something the occasional teacher can be bothered to do?

Customers DO already engage in conversations about the class, before and after, say on facebook if that is
where it is being discussed. They quite happily leave feedback there, because they like to
interact with the teacher after the class. They talk about how much they enjoyed it, etc. And engaging
with this commentary is valuable for the teacher because it gains them more notice in the community.

So we can't take that commentary totally away from that community - it still needs to happen in facebook
or wherever else it happened. But maybe we can copy it in - can we track the commentary on a post created
by the teacher, and aggregate that? This would then continue to be a benefit for a teacher, but would
enable us to build the site content for later benefit to customers without having to treat them as
resources in the earlier stages. But we would have to know how to get that data, what rights we / the
teacher has to it, and it would not necessarily indicate positive/negative review, although we could
do sentiment analysis on it.

Before a class a teacher will plan what they want to teach in that class. They will decide what moves they
want to do. The class may not go exactly like that, but they still have a rough idea. Perhaps we support
them write that plan, then after the class (or before) they share it with the group as feedback - so, a
review for everyone in the group, even though not customised. Any specific feedback for a particular member
of the group can also be given, or perhaps certain users expect tailored feedback and so they ask for it,
and even maybe pay more, if that is what they want.

As much of this as possible should happen where the community already is - that is, on facebook, or other
social sites where people are sharing information and planning things. Although there is value in a teacher
making their own facebook page or group, and creating events there, it is not necessarily that useful for
them to put a lot of effort into advertising their group/page per se - instead they should join other
groups themselves and from there ask for people who are interested to come to train with them, and THEN
make an event when organising with a group of people who are already interested. That event can be hosted
by their own page/group, rather than them as an individual, so that there is a record there of what they
have taught.

Then, the individual teacher (or their page/group, whichever is best) should join the bebejam buddies group.
That group can be for trainers to help them find other trainers who may be interested in teaching where
they teach, or in taking over their classes when they move on. The previous feedback / class descriptions
of the teacher before, will help a new teacher know what the customers are capable of. And the customers
will have a record of what they have done, to help them gauge which new trainer they might want next.

So Bebejam should really be nothing more than this community itself - some helpful explanations about how
a trainer should use facebook to find customers, and a group containing those trainers, to share info. When
they make events, and give and get feedback on their events, we can scrape that data to provide an analytics
overview app, and also an app/bot that can join in conversations to help plan events. One of the things
that would also be useful is an overview of the locations people choose for their events so that others
can easily find those locations in a given area - we don't help them book those locations, but can collect
info about where they are, and could prompt trainers who use them to provide some more info about them.

Secondarily, long term there will grow a collection of data, and an app, that customers can actually
use to find trainers directly, and to check their reputations. Also, trainers will be able to see info
about customers, such as their progress, and whether or not they regularly don't pay (if we go for a
sort-of pitch-in price model). Trainers can also search for other trainers to help / take over their
classes, and can find other trainers who have taught or are training in places where the trainer
would like to go to, to see how popular it is there, what spaces are available, etc.

This means that goals and motivation for individuals is out of Bebejam. But it can be a separate app
that someone can use to help motivate themselves or a friend. Also, if we collect location information,
we can secondarily generate an app for recording useful training spaces, and then advertise that directly
as a service worth listing on, for people trying to offer spaces.
