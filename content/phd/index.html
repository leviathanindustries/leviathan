        <p>Social and technical advancements have enabled a greater degree of communication and collaboration than ever before. This has allowed <b>software development</b> practices to become agile, able to value individuals and interactions over tools and processes, and to localise developments with user communities; it has driven the evolution of <b>digital scholarship</b> which has vastly increased the quantity of research material potentially available to scholars, and greatly simplified the task of sharing research data; and the unprecedented accessibility to and potential scale of collaborative research has driven a number of <b>open movements</b> seeking to augment the societal and institutional boundaries that traditionally characterise what it means to be a scholar, a researcher, and even a member of a given community or society.</p>
        <p>These three are related: development yields new tools and access to resources, which enable digital scholarship, which in turn drives open movements that seek to reconstruct community traditions, so that community <b>values</b> can continue to be <b>practiced</b> in new ways.</p>

        <p>The specialist nature of advanced work in research and/or development implies a degree of <b>localisation</b>. But as individuals and teams try new tools and develop new practices, they may then find themselves at odds with their professional community (their locality), prompting some form and degree of <b>delocalisation</b> (an open movement). Whilst this may be quite a natural and perhaps necessary part of development, the proliferation of movements suggests that delocalisation is problematic.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, localisation affects the development process itself, which may be contributing to the problematisation of delocalisation. Contrasting examples of this are found when developments are limited in either their <b>technical</b> or <b>social</b> scope, exacerbating subsequent attempts at delocalisation. If development of technology and development of society can instead be considered as a hybrid art, then advancing a practice of <b>technosocial</b> development may mitigate this.</p>
